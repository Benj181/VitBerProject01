    "The plots above shows our simulated cycle-average of the particle current as a function of $\\alpha$, compared to the analytical model of $J_{avg}$. We observe the simulated model to be an adequate approximation to the analytical equation, although it has some noticable noise on the boundries. The adjoining plot of the deviation for each $\\alpha$ will on the other hand illustrate that the noise on the boundries are of the same magnitude as the stable parts of the simulation. "
