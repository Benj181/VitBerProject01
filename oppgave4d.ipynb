    "First off the argument assumes that the particles \"will relax towards the potential minima\", this is not true if the number of times steps in each potetial, $T_{p}$, is too small. The particles won't have time to move into the potetial minimas and the particles will not have the distrubution $\\phi(x , t=T_{p} \\cdot n) \\sim \\delta(x)$ for $n \\in \\Z$, and hence not be normal distrubuted around $x=0$.\n",

    "Lastly we used a discretization of the x-axis and time steps, while the argument presented used a continuous space and time model. If $N_{x}$ becomes small these affects become more prevelent. But we did not notice these affects in excercise 4.\n"
