    "Using an energy scale argument, we consider the two extremes described in the two boundary conditions. In one extreme, the temperature is significantly larger than the energy potentials and as discussed above, this results in the energy potential being negligible to the probability. In the second extreme case the temperature is significantly smaller than the potentials. As a result, the energy potential plays the dominating role for the probabability. This is assuming that the potential energy grows monotonously as $x$ goes from smaller to bigger values of $x$. However, this might not always be the case. The potential might decrease monotonously, and it might oscillate. This will however not change the proposed argument. For higher temperatures, the potential will still be negligible, while lower temperatures will have probabilities dependant on the potential differences. \n",
